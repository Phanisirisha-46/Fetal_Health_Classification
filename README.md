# Fetal_Health_Classification
 ## Problem Statement
    The problem at hand revolves around the need for accurate and timely classification of fetal health conditions during pregnancy.  In this project, we had created a model to classify the outcome of a Cardiotocogram test to ensure the well being of the fetus. 
##  Data Collection
    This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetricians into 3 classes: Normal, Suspect, Pathological. It contains 5 rows, 22 columns.
## Data Pre-processing 
    Data preprocessing is a critical step in preparing the dataset for fetal health classification models. The goal is to ensure that the data is clean, appropriately formatted, and ready for training machine learning algorithms. When we run those preprocessors we get the result as 0, which means there are no duplicates or missing values. We had seen info and described the data sets. 

## DATA VISUALIZATION 
    Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to help people understand the patterns, trends, and insights within the data .It includes Pie chart, Line charts, Bar graphs, Maps.
